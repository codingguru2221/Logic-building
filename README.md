## Additional Sections

### 1. **Common Mistakes to Avoid**
- **Off-by-One Errors:** Common in loops and array indexing.
- **Infinite Loops:** Ensure correct loop termination conditions.
- **Ignoring Edge Cases:** Test for empty inputs, negative values, and extreme cases.
- **Overcomplicating Solutions:** Start simple and optimize later.
- **Not Using Debugging Tools:** Utilize debuggers to trace and fix issues.

### 2. **Effective Debugging Tips**
- **Understand Error Messages:** Read and interpret compiler/runtime errors.
- **Use Print Statements:** Print intermediate values to trace issues.
- **Step Through Code:** Debug line-by-line using debugging tools.
- **Verify Inputs & Outputs:** Ensure expected input and output values.
- **Isolate the Issue:** Test smaller sections of code to pinpoint problems.

### 3. **Best Practices for Clean Code**
- **Meaningful Variable Names:** Use descriptive names for variables and functions.
- **Modular Code:** Structure code into reusable functions/classes.
- **Consistent Formatting:** Maintain a uniform coding style.
- **Proper Documentation:** Add comments to explain complex logic.
- **Avoid Hardcoding:** Use constants or configuration files.

### 4. **Real-World Applications**
- **Data Structures in Daily Use:** (e.g., stacks in browser history, trees in file systems).
- **Algorithms in Industry:** (e.g., sorting in databases, pathfinding in GPS apps).
